I know that this program works well becuase, firstly, the first run uses the same variables as the
one on the example and has the same output. Also, looking at the progression of balances which decreases
and the interest payed that decreases, it seems to make conventional sense. Moreover, the program ends
when it comes to zero balance which is correct.
